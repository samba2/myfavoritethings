Provides small record labels with the ability to add a download voucher to their vinyl record releases. This download voucher contains an URL + a One time code to download the whole record as ZIP file containing MP3 files.

The label owner can create new download projects and manage existing downloads by the help of a web interface. Creating a new download project as well as producing the vouchers is just a matter of a few clicks.
