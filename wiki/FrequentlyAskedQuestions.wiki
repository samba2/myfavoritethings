*Why is it called _My Favorite Things_?*

Well there are two reasons. Being a passionate vinyl lover my records are quite often my favorite things. Secondly, when I was writting the very first version of the program (well, this was acutally a different single script program serving the same purpose) I was listening the "My Favorite Things" by John Coltrane.

*Can I contribute?*

Oh yes, please do. At the moment it is only me developing the software, trying some (not very nice) web layout and maintaing this project page. What I am looking for are possibly those roles:
  * Perl Developer
  * CSS Style Sheet designer
  
However, if you feel you want to contribute (also in different areas) just get in contact with me: maiktoepfer@googlemail.com

*I am missing a feature, what can I do?*

Please have a look if it is already on the FeatureWork page. If not just drop me a line.

*Arn't you destroying someone else's business by giving away the software for free?*

No, I don't think so. _My Favorite Things_ was developed having small DIY labels in mind which most of the time invest a lot of free time providing music lovers like me with fantastic undiscovered material. 
Looking at my record collection over the years I have bought quite a lot of music releases by these small labels. This is my kind of appreciation of their work.
But I admit there is also a very practical reason for spending 3 month free time for the first release of _My Favorite Things_: It still p...es me off buying records without download option having to do all the Audacity recording/ MP3 conversion my self. I hope _My Favorite Things_ will change this a little bit.

*So your a music lover as well, what kind of?*
Well, over the years the genres a getting more. Not sure if this is a good sign or not ;-)   The first love is indie pop, the classic or currently maybe the swedish way. No "big balls" heavy rock'n'roll but gently bubbling pop anthems. Good bands of the genre: The Field Mice (gone), The Acid House Kings (still there), The Pains of Being Pure At Heart (also new).
Second big interest is old soul music. Preferably mid/ late 60ies and early 70ies.  Northern soul, rare soul, soul nighters and soul weekenders - this is all important here. Like this english documentry once said "For 2 minutes 30 the whole world is magic." There is nothing to add here.
And there is "everything else" which is: Listening Electronic, Jazz, Classical Music, Americana, Singer/ Songwriter and like I sayed - it is getting more and more...
