This page will show you how to use _My Favorite Things_ . We will login, create a new release and eventually print out the download vouchers. For all this _My Favorite Things_ needs to be installed which is described under [Installation].

== Logging In ==
If you have finished the [Installation] just replace the `install.cgi` part of the installer web address with `Releases.cgi`

So you login to the admin menu via the address
`http://your-domain.name/cgi-bin/MyFavoriteThings/cgi/Releases.cgi`
