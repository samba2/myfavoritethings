This page will show you how to use _My Favorite Things_ . We will login, create a new release and eventually print out the download vouchers. For all this _My Favorite Things_ needs to be installed which is described under [Installation].

== Logging In ==
If you have finished the [Installation] just replace the `install.cgi` part of the installer web address with `Releases.cgi`

So you login to the admin menu via the address
`http://your-domain.name/cgi-bin/MyFavoriteThings/cgi/Releases.cgi`

After entering the admin password you have chosen during install, you get presented the main admin screen. Lets add a new release (= download code project). 

== Creating a new release ==
Generally creating a new release consists out of the following steps:
  * Entering release title and release code
  * Specify the amount of download codes needed
  * Define the public download web address of your release
  * Uploading the Zip file containing the download codes

At this stage the release is created. It is now possible to print out the download vouchers which _My Favorite Things_ sends to you as PDF file via your web browser.
