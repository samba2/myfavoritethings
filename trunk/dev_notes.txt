In order to make the application running only with the Perl core modules some changes inside the  modules where necessary:

Enable Perl-only DBI-Mode
-------------------------
to enable the perl only database interface in MyFav::DB::General.pm
right in front of the "use DBI;" line the enviroment variable
DBI_PUREPERL is set to "2" which equals to "use always pure perl"

BEGIN { $ENV{DBI_PUREPERL}=2 }


SQL/Statement.pm
----------------
use Clone qw(clone);
on lines 24 + 1836 replaced with
use Clone::PP qw(clone);

comment:
Clone.pm contains C-object code and has to be compiled
PP.pm is the Perl-only replacement

CGI::Application::Plugin::RateLimit
-----------------------------------
i had to adapt the module to get it running with dbd::anydata.
the following SQL access methods where changed:
record_hit_sth, check_violation_sth, revoke_hit_sth
changed "$dbh->quote_identifier($self->table)" to "$self->table"
